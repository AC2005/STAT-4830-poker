## Reinforcement Learning/Self-Play using PyPokerEngine

PyPokerEngine allows us to create player instances that exist in a game environment. They can receive game data and output moves, and our model (after some input parsing/cleaning) will read in the info and output a valid move.

Example:

```python
from pypokerengine.api.game import setup_config, start_poker

config = setup_config(max_round=200, initial_stack=200, small_blind_amount=5)
config.register_player(name="p1", algorithm=PokerZero())
config.register_player(name="p2", algorithm=PokerZero())
config.register_player(name="p3", algorithm=PokerZero())
game_result = start_poker(config, verbose=1)
```

We can then save game logs to observe performance or use it as training data to feed back into our model.

### Reinforcement Learning

PyPokerEngine provides a powerful Emulator class specifically designed for reinforcement learning applications. Here's how we'll utilize it in our implementation:

1. **Game State Management**

    - The Emulator class allows us to simulate poker games and track game states
    - We can restore and manipulate game states, enabling exploration of different scenarios
    - Perfect for training our model through experience replay and state exploration

2. **Player Implementation**

    ```python
    class PokerZero(BasePokerPlayer):
        def receive_game_start_message(self, game_info):
            # Initialize emulator with game parameters
            self.emulator = Emulator()
            self.emulator.set_game_rule(
                player_num=game_info["player_num"],
                max_round=game_info["rule"]["max_round"],
                small_blind_amount=game_info["rule"]["small_blind_amount"],
                ante_amount=game_info["rule"]["ante"]
            )

            # Register player models for simulation
            for player in game_info["seats"]["players"]:
                self.emulator.register_player(player["uuid"], UnslothModel())

        def declare_action(self, valid_actions, hole_card, round_state):
            # Convert game state for model input
            game_state = restore_game_state(round_state)

            # Use emulator to simulate possible outcomes
            # Returns will be used for model training and action selection
            future_states = []
            for action in valid_actions:
                next_state, events = self.emulator.apply_action(game_state, action)
                future_states.append((action, next_state))

            # Model selects best action based on simulated outcomes
            return self.model.select_action(future_states)
    ```

3. **Training Process**

    - Use self-play with multiple instances of our UnslothPokerPlayer
    - Collect game experiences through emulator simulations
    - Update model weights based on game outcomes and reward signals
    - Leverage the emulator's ability to run complete game simulations for better policy learning

4. **Advantages of This Approach**
    - Efficient state simulation and exploration
    - Built-in game rule enforcement
    - Support for multiple players in training scenarios
    - Perfect for implementing self-play training methodology

This integration will allow us to create a robust training environment for our poker AI, combining PyPokerEngine's poker-specific functionality with our Unsloth-based reinforcement learning model.
