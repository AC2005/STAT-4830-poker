# Implementation Updates

## Training Infrastructure Improvements

---

### üéØ **Unsloth Optimization for T4 GPUs**

- Successfully migrated training from A100 GPUs to T4 GPUs using Unsloth's notebook optimizations
- Enables more cost-effective and accessible training
- Maintains model quality with extended training times

---

### üß± **Response Structure Revisions**

- Implemented a structured output format for LLM
- Encourages explicit reasoning rather than only providing decisions
- Reward Functions now evaluate:
  - **Structure Compliance**: Rewards proper tag structure
  - **Reasoning Quality**: Assesses depth, relevance, and logic
  - **Decision Alignment**: Ensures reasoning supports the final decision
- More lenient rewards for faster convergence

---

## Reinforcement Learning Implementation

---

### ü§ñ **Self-Play with PPO**

- Implemented **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for self-play using PyPokerEngine
- Features:
  - 6-player poker games with model instances competing against each other
  - Gameplay data collection for continuous improvement
  - Competitive reinforcement learning for decision refinement

---

### üìà **GRPO Training Challenges**

- Integrated **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** for enhanced learning
- Challenges faced:
  - **Computational Intensity**: Significant time required for updates
  - **Complexity Management**: Poker's vast state space adds difficulty
  - **Long Runtimes**: Full training cycles are resource-intensive
- Further optimization needed for practical training cycles

---

## Enhanced Reward Functions

### üõ† **Verbal Descriptions**

- **Structure Compliance**:  
  Models are rewarded for adhering to predefined tag formats. This ensures consistent output, making evaluation and debugging easier.

- **Reasoning Quality**:  
  Reasoning sections are assessed for relevance and logical consistency. More detailed and insightful reasoning results in higher rewards.

- **Decision Alignment**:  
  Models earn rewards when the final decision logically follows from the reasoning. Misalignment is penalized to reinforce accurate decision-making.

- **Granular Feedback**:  
  Rewards are applied incrementally, reducing punishment for minor errors while encouraging incremental improvements.

## Next Steps

### ‚è© **Training Efficiency**
- Explore:
  - Smaller models for faster fine-tuning
  - Algorithmic improvements to reduce compute intensity

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Reward Function Refinements**
- Detect and mitigate reward hacking
- Enhance feedback for better reasoning quality

### üß™ **Model Evaluation**
- Current Method: Track average chip differences in games
- Future Exploration:  
  - Evaluate using PokerBench dataset  
  - Compare against GTO (Game Theory Optimal) results for objective assessment
