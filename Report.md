# **Reasoning Model for No-Limit Hold’em Poker**

## **1. Problem Statement**

We seek to develop a **reasoning model** optimized for no-limit hold’em poker. The goal is to **maximize expected value (EV)** by refining strategic and adaptive play based on opponents’ behavior. Success in poker extends beyond mere monetary gain: it highlights progress in **reasoning under incomplete information**, **adversarial settings**, and **strategic adaptation**, with applications in **game theory**, **economic modeling**, and **negotiation**.

### **Success Metrics**
1. **Expected Value per Hand (EV)** – Primary performance criterion.  
2. **Win Rate vs. Various Opponents** – Includes human players and equilibrium-based bots.  
3. **Unpredictability and Robustness** – Ability to avoid repetitive, exploitable patterns.  
4. **Computational Efficiency** – Must balance decision-making depth with real-time constraints.

### **Constraints**
- **Computational Resources** – Training and inference must run efficiently in real time.  
- **Data Availability** – Requires diverse hand histories and potentially annotated strategy data.  

### **Risks and Challenges**
- **Data Quality** – Many hands end without revealing all cards; human data often contains suboptimal plays.  
- **Combinatorial Explosion** – Over 56 billion possible hand combinations per player can lead to heavy computation.

### **Prior Work**
- **PokerBench** – Trained LLMs to become professional poker players.  
- **PokerGPT** – Lightweight solver leveraging a large language model.  
- **Pluribus** – Demonstrated multi-player, near-GTO strategies.

## **2. Technical Approach and Methodology**

### **2.1 Fine-tuning LLM**
We fine-tune a small distilled DeepSeek R1 model to take in a text description of the poker hands at the table, and output a decision ("raise", "check", "fold", etc.). 

### **2.2 Self-Play with PyPokerEngine**
Self-play allows the model to refine its policy by continually encountering diverse scenarios. **PyPokerEngine** provides a controlled environment for simulated hands and backpropagation of rewards.

## **3. Mathematical Formulation**

1. **Maximize Expected Value (EV)**  
   $$\max \mathbb{E}[\text{Winnings per action}]$$
   Focuses on **long-term gains**, rather than immediate outcomes.

3. **Minimize Regret**  
   $$\min \sum_{t=1}^{T} \bigl(\text{Best Possible Outcome} - \text{Chosen Action Outcome}\bigr)$$
   Ensures the strategy converges toward optimal play by evaluating performance gaps over time.

### **Constraints**
- **Buy-In/Bankroll** – Actions must respect a fixed bankroll to avoid rapid depletion.  
- **Time Constraint** – In online poker, quick decisions are critical.  
- **Limited Opponent Information** – Must infer betting patterns, bluffs, and style from limited data.

---

## **4. Algorithm Choice & Justification**

**Reasoning Model** – A specialized model focusing on decision-making is both more **transparent** and **efficient** for this task. A reasoning model would be able to make the complex decisions required for poker, since players must anticipate other players' actions in poker. Models like traditional Game-Theory Optimal models take too much computational power for each handm, while reasoning models may be able to generalize better across the many possible hands in poker.

---

## **5. PyTorch Implementation Strategy**

1. **Model Fine-Tuning**  
   - Begin with a reasoning-focused architecture (e.g., “ragen”) and adapt it to poker features (pot odds, hand strength, opponent modeling).  

2. **Integration with PyPokerEngine**  
   - A **PyTorch wrapper** orchestrates end-to-end training, simulating each hand and updating model parameters via reward signals.

---

## **6. Validation Methods**

1. **Comparisons to GTO Lines**  
   - Test against well-known Game Theory Optimal strategies in controlled scenarios.  
2. **Practical Play**  
   - Evaluate performance (profitability, EV) in real or simulated online settings over large sample sizes.

---

## **7. Resource Requirements & Constraints**

- **GPU/Cloud Resources** – Needed for large-scale self-play simulations and neural network training.  
- **Poker Data** – Historical hand histories plus annotated strategy examples to bootstrap learning.  
- **Time & Budget** – Must ensure real-time inference while controlling training costs.

---

## **8. Conclusion**

By blending **Deep Q-Learning**, **action abstraction**, and **self-play**, we aim for a **profitable, robust**, and **adaptable** poker AI. A **PyTorch-based** approach facilitates modular, iterative refinement, with **validation** through known optimal lines and real-world testing.

## **Initial Results**

Our first experiments using **GPT-2** produced **0% accuracy**: the model rehashed prompts rather than providing actionable poker decisions. In contrast, larger models (e.g., **GPT-4**) or specialized **reasoning models** yielded correct decisions. This confirms:
- **Smaller LLMs** struggle to output concise, strategic moves.  
- **Reasoning-focused approaches** excel in structured, decision-heavy tasks.

### **Basic Performance Metrics**
- **Win Rates vs. Baseline** – Measured against simple bots or static strategies.  
- **Decision Accuracy** – Comparing actions to known GTO or expert plays.  
- **Consistency** – Reliability across varied game scenarios.

### **Current Limitations**
- **Insufficient Compute** – Complex tasks require more powerful models.  
- **Unconstrained LLM Output** – Tendency to produce verbose text instead of concise actions.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Restrict LLM Output**  
   - Limit generation to short, action-oriented phrases: “check”, “fold”, “raise 20”, etc.
2. **Use More Powerful Reasoning Models**  
   - Explore GPT-4 or specialized “DeepSeek-R1”–style distilled networks.
3. **Data Pipeline**  
   - Annotate additional plays and systematically feed them to the model (inspired by **PokerBench**).
4. **Improve Efficiency**  
   - Address heavy computational demands by optimizing training loops and pruning less critical model components.

### **Open Questions**
- **Beyond Fine-Tuning** – How to integrate advanced RL or hierarchical reasoning?  
- **Constrained Output** – Which methods are best for limiting large-language-model responses?  
- **Validating Partial Information** – Techniques to confirm logic with hidden opponent cards?

### **Alternative Approaches**
- **Standalone Reasoning Models** (non-LLM)  
- **Pure Reinforcement Learning** (tabular or approximate)  
- **Hybrid** with both GTO solvers and approximate RL/LLM components

### **Key Learnings**
- **Smaller LLMs** fail to produce reliable, concise moves.  
- **Game-Theory Optimal** approaches are **computationally expensive**, requiring careful abstraction.
