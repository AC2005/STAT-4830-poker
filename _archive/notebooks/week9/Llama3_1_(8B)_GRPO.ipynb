However, since BB called HJ's raise on the turn, HJ may not have a very strong hand. Considering BB checked on the river while letting HJ act first, this suggests that BB is not sure about the strength of their hand in comparison to HJ's. Therefore, the pot is likely getting bigger due to players either hitting their draws or playing aggressively with weak hands, expecting to trap. Given this analysis, calling would be the safest play because it still allows me to see one more card and possibly take the pot with a strong hand or potentially get more information with a weaker hand. \n",

              "'**Calculating Pi using Python**\\n\\nPi (π) is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle\\'s circumference to its diameter. Here\\'s a simple and efficient way to calculate an approximation of pi using Python.\\n\\n### Using the Monte Carlo Method\\n\\nThe Monte Carlo method is a computational algorithm that uses random sampling to approximate a value. In this case, we can use it to estimate pi by generating random points within a square and checking if they fall inside a quarter-circle inscribed within it.\\n\\n```python\\nimport random\\nimport math\\n\\ndef estimate_pi(num_samples):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Estimate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    num_samples (int): The number of random points to generate.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: An approximation of pi.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    points_inside_circle = 0\\n\\n    for _ in range(num_samples):\\n        x, y = random.random(), random.random()\\n        distance = x**2 + y**2\\n        if distance <= 1:\\n            points_inside_circle += 1\\n\\n    return (points_inside_circle / num_samples) * 4\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nnum_samples = 1000000\\napprox_pi = estimate_pi(num_samples)\\nprint(f\"Approximation of pi with {num_samples} samples: {approx_pi}\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code generates `num_samples` random points within the square (-1, -1) to (1, 1) and checks if each point falls inside the quarter-circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of samples multiplied by 4 gives an approximation of pi.\\n\\n### Using the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe Formula\\n\\nThe Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) formula is another way to calculate pi. It\\'s a spigot algorithm that uses a series expansion to generate the digits of pi.\\n\\n```python\\ndef bbp_pi(n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculate the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula for pi.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    n (int): The number of terms to use in the series expansion.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: An approximation of pi.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    pi = 0.0\\n    for k in range(n):\\n        pi += (1 / (16 ** k)) * (\\n            4 / (8 * k + 1) -\\n            2 / (8 * k + 4) -\\n            1 / (8 * k + 5) -\\n            1 / (8 * k + 6)\\n        )\\n    return pi\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nn = 100\\napprox_pi = bbp_pi(n)\\nprint(f\"Approximation of pi with {n} terms: {approx_pi}\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code calculates an approximation of pi using the BBP formula with `n` terms.\\n\\n### Using the Gauss-Legendre Algorithm\\n\\nThe Gauss-Legendre algorithm is another method for calculating pi. It\\'s a recursive algorithm that uses an iterative process to improve the estimate of pi.\\n\\n```python\\ndef gauss_legendre(n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculate pi using the Gauss-Legendre algorithm.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    n (int): The number of iterations.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: An approximation of pi.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    a, b = 1.0, (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2.0\\n    t = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 4.0\\n    p = 1.0\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        a, b = (a + b) / 2.0, math.sqrt(a * b)\\n        t -= p * (a - b)\\n        p *= 2.0\\n        a = a + t / p\\n        b = math.sqrt(b - t / p)\\n    return a * b * 16.0\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nn = 100\\napprox_pi = gauss_legendre(n)\\nprint(f\"Approximation of pi with {n} iterations: {approx_pi}\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code calculates an approximation of pi using the Gauss-Legendre algorithm with `n` iterations.\\n\\nRemember that these are simplified examples and may not be the most efficient or accurate methods for calculating pi. For more accurate calculations, you can use specialized libraries or software.'"
