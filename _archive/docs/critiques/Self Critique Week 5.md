## Critical Risks/Assumptions

The **availability of high-quality poker training datasets** may limit the ability to model complex strategies effectively. Furthermore, we **assume that PPO and GRPO will generalize well** to poker-specific decision-making, though additional testing may be required. Finally, **resource constraints** have served to reduce the models we are able to use, and training the models acts as a time suck.

## DECIDE: Plan Your Next Steps

### Concrete Next Actions

1. **Continue to implement our reasoning model** We hope to get a model working with the unsloth training method in Colab, outputting correct poker moves. Currently it outputs only semi-correct moves, as well as a huge amount of reasoning.
2. **Analyze real-world poker AI models**, comparing existing implementations to our proposed RL approaches.
3. **Explore hardware requirements**, ensuring computational feasibility for training and deploying large-scale RL models.

## ACT: Prepare for Execution

- **Acquire more diverse poker data** We hope to expand the data that we have with different poker datasets and different formats to help make our reasoning models better
- **Optimize computational resources**, securing access to high-performance GPUs for RL model training.

## Resource Needs

We require **access to high-capacity computing infrastructure** for model training and **relevant poker datasets** to validate model predictions. Reviewing case studies of existing poker AI will further enhance our approach.
