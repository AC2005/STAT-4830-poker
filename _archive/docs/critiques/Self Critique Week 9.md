# Self-Critique

## Strengths

- **Successful training infrastructure adaptation** from high-end A100 GPUs to more accessible T4 GPUs through Unsloth optimization
- **Implementation of structured reasoning format** with clear separation between reasoning process and action decisions
- **Application-focused analysis** bridging reinforcement learning models with practical poker decision-making
- **Well-structured implementation approach** from foundational principles to advanced policy optimization techniques
---

## Areas for Improvement

- **Provide more empirical comparisons** between our model and existing poker AI implementations
- **Address the computational challenges** of GRPO training with its extended runtimes
- **Refine reward functions** to better evaluate structured reasoning and decision alignment in poker contexts

## Critical Risks/Assumptions

The **availability of high-quality poker training datasets** may limit the ability to model complex strategies effectively. We **assume that PPO and GRPO will generalize well** to poker-specific decision-making, though our implementation is still proving challenging. **Resource constraints** have reduced the models we can effectively use, and GRPO training in particular is proving computationally intensive with extended runtimes. The **ability of LLMs to learn poker logic** is also a critical assumption that may or may not be true, since our datasets do not contain actual explanations about the intuition or statistics behind why certain moves are optimal. Withou these explanations, it may be hard for our reasoning models to produce better lines of reasoning and better outputs.

## DECIDE: Plan Your Next Steps

### Concrete Next Actions

1. **Continue refining our reasoning model** with the structured output format using `<reasoning></reasoning>` and `<answer></answer>` tags
2. **Implement self-play with PPO** through PyPokerEngine with 6-player poker games
3. **Optimize reward functions** for more granular feedback while maintaining structure compliance
4. **Compare our approach** with existing poker AI implementations
5. **Balance GRPO training** thoroughness with practical time constraints

## ACT: Prepare for Execution

- **Expand our training data** with diverse poker datasets and formats to improve reasoning model performance
- **Continue optimizing for T4 GPUs** while balancing computational efficiency and training quality
- **Implement and refine the structured output format** to capture both reasoning process and actions
- **Create validation methods** to numerically evaluate how well our model is doing and improving

## Resource Needs

We require **access to computing infrastructure** for model training, now adapted to T4 GPUs but still constrained by GRPO's computational demands over large datasets. We need **diverse poker datasets** to validate model predictions and continued optimization of our training process.
